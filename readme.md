React app + pure css  
A number input and a button. It only accept numbers (negative or positive integers or floats with one decimal)  
Each time you click on the Add counter button, it will add a new counter on the page that has a default zero value.  
Each counter has a Run button that clicking on it will add its step value to the current value. So if we have 3 counters with different steps it should result like this:  
Step: 3. Results: 0, 3, 6, 9, 12  
Step: -2.6. Results: 0, -2.6, -5.2, -7.8
